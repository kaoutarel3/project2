This project leverages Streamlit to develop an interactive platform where users can upload PDF documents. The system processes the PDF to automatically generate flashcards, aiding in the extraction and memorization of key information. Additionally, a chatbot is integrated to provide on-demand, context-driven responses based on the content of the uploaded PDF, facilitating efficient information retrieval and enhancing the user learning experience.
